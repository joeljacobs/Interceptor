# Interceptor
Code and info for a Gas Pedal Interceptor for use with Open Pilot

Readme is a work in progress. I already created a wiki, but it was lost. For now, some resources:



### D-to-A chip: Microchip MCP4822

### CAN Module I used:

### CAN Arduino Shield that I should have probably used instead:

### OBDII splitter:

### Altered Arduino library for the Can Module (This library is altered to use the slower clock on the specific module, generic library should be fine for the shield):
